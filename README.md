Task Manager API

A lightweight, robust, and scalable API for managing tasks. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this project provides a clean structure for CRUD operations and follows modular principles for scalability and maintainability.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks efficiently.
	‚Ä¢	Error Handling: Custom error handlers for clean and informative responses.
	‚Ä¢	Modular Design: Easy to scale with distinct modules for controllers, middleware, and routes.
	‚Ä¢	Database Integration: MongoDB with Mongoose for schema-based interaction.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend Integration: Sample frontend with HTML/CSS and Axios for API requests.

üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

1. Controller

Handles the business logic of the application. Contains all API request handlers for tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Example: getAllTasks, getTask, createTask, updateTask, and deleteTask.
	‚Ä¢	Uses an asyncWrapper for error management.

2. Database (db)

Contains the database connection setup for MongoDB using Mongoose.
	‚Ä¢	Example: connectDB function to establish and export the connection.

3. Errors

Defines custom error classes and handlers.
	‚Ä¢	Includes:
	‚Ä¢	CustomAPIError: A custom class extending the base Error class.
	‚Ä¢	Error messages and status codes for better error handling.

4. Middleware

Handles request-response lifecycle management.
	‚Ä¢	Files:
	‚Ä¢	async: Wraps async functions for cleaner error catching.
	‚Ä¢	errorHandler: Centralized error handler for consistent API responses.
	‚Ä¢	notFound: Middleware for handling 404 (Not Found) errors.

5. Models

Defines the MongoDB schema for tasks using Mongoose.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Task schema with properties such as name, completed, etc.

6. Router

Defines the API endpoints and routes them to the respective controller functions.
	‚Ä¢	Example Routes:
	‚Ä¢	GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
	‚Ä¢	POST /tasks: Create a new task.
	‚Ä¢	PUT /tasks/:id: Update a specific task.
	‚Ä¢	DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task.

7. Public

Contains the frontend assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	‚Ä¢	Uses Axios for making API requests to the backend.
	‚Ä¢	Example: task.html and associated CSS files.

8. Sample

Contains supplementary pages and resources like error pages.

9. .gitignore

Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
	‚Ä¢	Examples: node_modules, .env.

10. app.js

The central entry point of the application.
	‚Ä¢	Initializes the server, middleware, routes, and error handlers.

11. package.json

Specifies project metadata and dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	Key Dependencies:
	‚Ä¢	dotenv: For managing environment variables.
	‚Ä¢	express: Web framework.
	‚Ä¢	mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool.
	‚Ä¢	nodemon: Development tool for automatic server restarts.

üîß Setup and Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Set up the .env file:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-db-connection-string>
PORT=<desired-port-number>


	4.	Run the server:

npm start

üõ†Ô∏è Usage

API Endpoints
	‚Ä¢	GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
	‚Ä¢	POST /tasks: Create a new task.
	‚Ä¢	GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a task by ID.
	‚Ä¢	PUT /tasks/:id: Update a task by ID.
	‚Ä¢	DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by ID.

Frontend
	‚Ä¢	Access the frontend via the public directory:
	‚Ä¢	Open task.html in a browser.
	‚Ä¢	Use the interface to interact with the API.
